So while putting this together i looked through what the user looks like, and tbh server is just its inverse.
Didn't get to test what i made either but its mostly stuff that I know works from the past, I changed a couple of things and only took the mostly
    relevant and related portions.
We just need to translate the jist of server into python and change the stuff mentioned in the comments throughout a couple of functions
Get server to be able to accept messages from client
Figure out how to connect multiple users together
Encorporate the encrytion algos
Leave chuck for last
